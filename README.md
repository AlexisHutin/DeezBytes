  <p><em>Directory Size Exporter for Prometheus</em></p>
</div>


**DeezBytes** is a lightweight Prometheus exporter that keeps an eye on the size of your directories. You get live metrics about how much disk space your important folders are eating up â€” perfect for monitoring and alerting.

[![CI/CD Docker](https://github.com/AlexisHutin/DeezBytes/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AlexisHutin/DeezBytes/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml)

---

## Whatâ€™s the deal?

- Watch multiple directories, configured via a simple YAML file
- Get size metrics labeled by directory name, straight into Prometheus

---

## Getting started

### Configuration

Create your config file (`config.yml`) with the directories you want to watch. For example:

```yaml
directories:
  - path: "/var/log"
    label: "var_log"
  - path: "/home/alex/data"
    label: "alex_data"
```

Nothing fancy â€” just tell DeezBytes where to look and what to call it.

---

### Build it

Grab the source and build:

```bash
go build -o deezbytes main.go
```

---

### Run it

Start the exporter with defaults:

```bash
./deezbytes
```

Defaults:  
- Config: `./config.yml`  
- Port: `9101`  
- Collection timeout: `15s`

You can override these with environment variables or flags (see below).

---

### Environment variables & flags

| Name / Flag                | What it does                                     | Default         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `CONFIG_PATH`              | Path to your config YAML file                    | `./config.yml`  |
| `EXPORTER_PORT`            | Port for the HTTP metrics endpoint               | `9101`          |
| `-disable-exporter-metrics` | Disable built-in Go and process metrics          | `false`         |
| `-collection-timeout`      | Max time to spend collecting directory sizes     | `15s`           |

Example running with timeout and metrics disabled:

```bash
./deezbytes -collection-timeout=10s -disable-exporter-metrics
```

---

### What metrics?

- `directory_size_bytes{name="<label>"}` â€” size of each monitored directory in bytes

Plus the usual Go runtime and process metrics, unless you disable them.

---

### Hook it up to Prometheus

Add this job in your Prometheus config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "deezbytes"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9101"]
```

Then youâ€™re good to go.

---

## TODO

- **Dockerfile:** create an official Docker image for easy deployment  
- **Docker Compose:** example setup for quick testing with Prometheus + DeezBytes  
- **CI/CD:** add GitHub Actions or other pipeline for automated build & test  
- **Grafana example:** dashboard config to visualize directory size trends 
- **Documentation:** a better doc to explain things
